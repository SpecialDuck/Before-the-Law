# Before the Law
This short work is an experiment in adapting classic literature to the medium of interactive fiction. Here, I attempt to adapt Franz Kafka's parable "Before the Law" into a short interactive experience.

The text is adapted from [Ian Johnston's translation](https://www.kafka-online.info/before-the-law.html) of Kafka's work. The text has been modified for tense and perspective (e.g. "The man thinks about it" in the original becomes "You think about it" for this experience). I have attempted to minimize this editing to preserve the essence of the original work as much as possible.

This project was created with [Twine](https://twinery.org/)
